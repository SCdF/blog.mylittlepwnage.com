		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also an odd time for a reboot. Joss Whedon’s Buffyverse is still going in comic form, and the TV show only stopped 5 or so years ago.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think 5 years is strange for a reboot of a franchise. The Batman Begins movie was about that long after the Batman &amp; Robin movie, and Casino Royale was 4 years after the previous James Bond film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand not having Sarah Michelle Gellar (given she probably doesn&#039;t look like a teenager now) but not having Whedon does seem quite strange.&lt;/p&gt;
