		<description>&lt;p&gt;the American people are deeply stupid.. have been for a lot of years.. here they are looking at fixing health care while trusting that job to corrupt politicians on both sides.. it simply isn&#039;t going to happen.. Americans the deeply stupid ones have no problem wasting a Trillion dollars and counting invading non threatening weak piss ant countries and they don&#039;t mind borrowing trillions of dollars from communist countries along with anybody who will spare them a dime.. but tell them give health care to every American and they run screaming for words like freedom.. exactly what freedoms do they think they have that Canada or France don&#039;t have.. enlighten me.. Americans always pay more get less and tell themselves they are the greatest while their fellow citizens starve like third world citizens and while they themselves kiss up to leaders that make dictators look downright kind..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Garcia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh no the grammar is atrocious.. lets not focus on the substance lets attack the grammar..&lt;/p&gt;
