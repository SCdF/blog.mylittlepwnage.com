		<description>&lt;p&gt;@1: Black men gyrating wildly and rapping about meat; are you sure that&#039;s SFW?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@4: Obvious consequence of technosocial development is obvious. Newfags gtfo, &amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@8: TeamFortress had it right: grappling hooks make &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; better. And even if the combat mechanics/effects suck as badly as the first one, at least you&#039;ll have an alternative (in before James Byrd reenactments.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, best ridiculously deadpan narrator since the crew chief on the AC130 in that CoD4 mission.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Awesome - the start of the Wendy&#039;s video has a sample from Pink Floyd&#039;s &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;!&lt;/p&gt;
