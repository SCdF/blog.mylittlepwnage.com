		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just came back to my laptop and decided to look up Apostrophe. This Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&amp;oldid=273182826) is what I ended up reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read various parts and then &quot;Time, money, and similar&quot;.* In reading that I thought, hey I might be right ... but then I could also be wrong. I&#039;m not really sure, I&#039;ll read some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ended up reading &quot;Importance for disambiguation&quot; below the time content, and I&#039;ve now decided I know so very little about this subject I should have just kept to myself to begin with :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have my own questions about punctuation before and after an end quote mark. Usually I put a full stop inside the quotation, in this case a person could copy and paste the quote and not find what they&#039;re after because a full stop is not part of it. Drama!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Certainly satisfying to see a response. Could see over the last few days smaller parties developing and interest and raising questions. I thought it was funny to see some of Labour asking questions about how the previous review of 92a was undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed for some better decision making over the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
