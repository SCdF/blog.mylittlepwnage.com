		<description>&lt;p&gt;Just came back to my laptop and decided to look up Apostrophe. This Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apostrophe&amp;oldid=273182826) is what I ended up reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read various parts and then “Time, money, and similar”.* In reading that I thought, hey I might be right … but then I could also be wrong. I’m not really sure, I’ll read some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ended up reading “Importance for disambiguation” below the time content, and I’ve now decided I know so very little about this subject I should have just kept to myself to begin with :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have my own questions about punctuation before and after an end quote mark. Usually I put a full stop inside the quotation, in this case a person could copy and paste the quote and not find what they’re after because a full stop is not part of it. Drama!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Uh. Technical grammar analysis from someone completely untrained in technical grammar analysis follows:
It seems like &quot;seconds&quot; is possessive of &quot;time&quot; in that sentence, but I&#039;m pretty certain that the whole sentence is a shortening in the first place - not correct of the strictest grammatical rules. &quot;In 90 seconds of time.&quot; Since it is a shortening and seconds do not actually possess time, they are a measure of it, I think the apostrophe is technically incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But super cool use of an apostrophe anyway, I almost &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; remember to identify possessiveness in situations similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just read the link, and I think the other analysis is incorrect. But you can argue that &quot;In 90 seconds time&quot;, that is without the apostrophe, is incorrect also - except for the extremely commonplace use of the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
