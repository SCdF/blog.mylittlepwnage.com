		<description>&lt;p&gt;I agree with what you say about the script and the dialogue (so-bad-its-good) but personally I like it and it sets me in a pretty good mood while playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure it&#039;s not what we expected with the title  &#039;Prince of Persia&#039; and if you ask me, this game is shouldn&#039;t be called PoP because its very different by a lot of aspects (realism, story, graphics, characters...), either way this game is pretty damn good, and I like it very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the voice action doesn&#039;t seem so bad to me, it actually sounds good most of the times they speak.&lt;/p&gt;
